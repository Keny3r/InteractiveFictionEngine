## A passion project
I first heard about a game called Zork at university. The instructor mentioned it in a .NET game development course. I immediately fell in love with the genre and, against all advice (it was not an easy task), I set out to develop a similar (albeit more modest) game.  
I've made a few modifications since then, so now you can run and play a "demo" story in a C# environment.
